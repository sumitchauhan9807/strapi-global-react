The cookies have limited validity, contain no personal data and do not enable a personal identification. If you visit certain internet pages on our website and the cookie has not yet expired, we and Google can recognize that you clicked on the advertisement and were redirected to this site. Every Google AdWords customer receives a different cookie. It is therefore not possible for cookies to be tracked over the websites of Google AdWords customers. The information obtained with the help of the conversion cookie serves for the creation of conversion statistics for AdWords customers, who have selected conversion tracking. Hereby, the customers learn the total number of users that have clicked on their advert and have been redirected to a page with a conversion tracking tag. They receive, however, no information that can be used to personally identify users. If you do not want to participate in tracking, you can opt out by blocking the installation of cookies through a corresponding setting in your browser software (deactivation option). Upon opting out you will not be recorded in the conversion tracking statistics.
